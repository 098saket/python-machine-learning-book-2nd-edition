## Table of Contents and Code Notebooks

**Helpful installation and setup instructions can be found in the README.md file [code/](code/) subdirectory**

Simply click on the `open dir` links next to the chapter headlines to navigate to the chapter subdirectories located in the [code/](code/) subdirectory. You can also click on the `ipynb` links below to open and view the Jupyter notebook of each chapter directly on GitHub.

**Please note that these are just the code examples accompanying the book, which I uploaded for your convenience; be aware that these notebooks may not be useful without the formulae and descriptive text.**
